This app is just a thing I wanted to do for myself, but someone might find it useful as well.

The purpose of the app is to help the user with remembering what he ordered at a restaurant/bar.

The UI is simple.
The app uses a simple database stored locally to manage the items.
There is no network needed for it to work, since everything is stored locally.
The app is small, of course depending on how many orders you log, but for me it's 56MB so far.

Quick guide:

When you start the app, you are greeted by this screen prompting you to create new tab.

When you create the tab, you can add an item by clicking the "+" button.
When you do so, the add menu pops up.

In this menu, you can name the item, set it's price if you want, add it as a favourite or change it's colour.
When you confirm the selection, the item is added to your tab.

You can also change the name of the tab by clicking the white txt on the upper part of the screen.
(it's designet to not attract too much attention when not in use)
When you set the name, the name is displayed on the white background, but the text colour changes to black, so it's visible.

For changing colour, you have a nice and easy to use wheel to choose from.

You can delete the item just by swiping left with it.
You can also edit the already created item just by clicking on the name.
By doing so, you open up the edit menu, which is the same as add menu.

In this example, I set the price to 45 and marked it as a favourite.

Favourite means, that the item will automatically appear in every new list you create with the number 0 as it's count.
You can of course remove it from the list, but it stays as a favourite until you remove the favourite mark.
Favourites are stored seperatly, so you don't need any existing lists to keep them.

The price is optional. You can track how much you spend, but you don't have to. 
When you set at least one price of a item, the total appears at the bottom left of the screen.
You can set the currency it displays the number in by clicking on the total.

In the end you can end up with something like this.

Of course, you can add many more items.
Also when the name is too long, it just creates a new line of text under the previous one, so it looks neat at all times.

By clicking the Finish button, you can close the tab and return to the starting screen.
The app also saves the tab every time you change something, so that when you close the app and reopen it, you are greeted by your tab as you left it.
(it doesn't use up battery by continually saving every 10s or something like that)

Next feature is the tab book. 
You can enter the tab book by clicking on the icon in the top right.
When you do so, you are greeted by a list of your tabs.

You can enter the tab by clicking on the name and by doing so you can resume using the tab if you close it by accident.
You can also delete tabs if you want, but there is a confirmation popup to prevent you from accidentally tapping the delete button.

The same popup is present when deleting items in a tab, it's just different colour.
